<p>I thought having a degree in systems engineering and reading some books on systems thinking will equip my mind to be a better designer, and eventually a founder. I don&#39;t know about design and career and all that AI stuff, but I can&#39;t just un-notice things those things that seemingly are random and I quiet get obsessed with it to the point it start stinging my brain.</p>
<p>One of my recent obsession is with Revo or daala. And how its related to Simulation and Simulacra. Big words, but stick with me I will explain.</p>
<h2>The Original Function</h2>
<p>So the Revo is a truck. By design and purpose its a truck. By function its a truck too. The question is at what point the symbolism becomes so overpowering that a truck doesn&#39;t remain a truck anymore. How much culture and shared mental model can influence the reality to the point that a truck doesn&#39;t remain a truck anymore.</p>
<p>Those kinds of truck were initially used by people of influence who needed extra protection, be it army personelle or politicians. The choice of truck was by design, it can house the guards while having them a near 360 view of the surroundings. This became a preventive system by itself, not only the guards can stop the attack as it happen, they are also preventing it because the outsiders have a clear view of them too which indicated to the attacker that the target is not vulnerable.</p>
<h2>The Simulation Cascade</h2>
<p>The imitation phase hit predictably. People with moderate influence started getting Revos plus guards - still keeping some link between symbol and function. But economics shifted. Guards got expensive, complicated. The truck stayed affordable.</p>
<p>Middle-tier guys bought Revos minus the security. Pure theater now. Performance of power for people who can&#39;t tell real capability from borrowed symbols.</p>
<p>What happened next broke my brain a bit. The simulation started feeding on itself. Market responded by making &quot;civilian&quot; Revos - same look, less defensive capability. We got daala - simulation without original.</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re in full Baudrillard territory. People buy Revos not because they remember real protection, but because the script says it means strength. Symbol completely divorced from what it supposedly represents.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>The Inversion Point</h2>
<p>But here&#39;s where it gets properly weird. The hyperreal doesn&#39;t just replace the real, it consumes its own tail. The daala reaches critical mass and the whole symbolic order collapses into itself. What was meant to signify power now signifies the desperate need to appear powerful. The simulation doesn&#39;t just fail, it reveals its own emptiness so completely that it becomes a confession of weakness.</p>
<p>One day you&#39;re driving status, the next day you&#39;re driving insecurity. The same object, unchanged, but the entire symbolic matrix has flipped. The daala becomes a scarlet letter proof you believed in symbols that everyone now knows are hollow.</p>
<p>We&#39;re past the desert of the real now. We&#39;re in the desert of the fake, where even the fakes have become obviously fake. The Revo doesn&#39;t transport you anywhere except deeper into your own simulation sickness.</p>
